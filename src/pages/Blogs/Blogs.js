          What are the different ways to manage a state in a React application?
        </h1>
        <div className="text-center">
          <p>
            1.Communication state forms the backbone of your React Native app
            without you even knowing about it. Remember when you had requested a
            call back to an HTTP request? That’s when you introduced the
            communication system in your app.
            <br />
            2.Data state covers information that your React application stores
            temporarily for various business functions. Supposedly, you are
            building a project management app. The information stored in the
            data state will include the following things – project names,
            contacts, details about the clients, etc.
            <br />
            3.Contrary to the state mentioned above in a React app, the control
            state does not represent the application’s environment. Instead, it
            refers to the state which the user has input into the app. For
            example, form inputs, selected items, etc. Control state is known to
            be more diverse and versatile when it comes to storing information.
            <br />
            4.Session state contains information about the user of the
            application such as user id, permissions, passwords, etc. It may
            also include information on how the application should work
            according to a particular user’s preferences.
            <br />
            5.Location state is the UTF-8 display that appears in your URL bar.
            In fact, the L in URL stands for Locator! One of the most
            interesting facts about Location state is that you can give
            directions to a user to parts of the application that do not have
            unique URLs associated with them. Also, the HTML5 History API allows
            you to store states separately from the specific URL.

          How does prototypical inheritance work?
        </h1>
        <p>
          Every object with its methods and properties contains an internal and
          hidden property known as [[Prototype]]. The Prototypal Inheritance is
          a feature in javascript used to add methods and properties in objects.
          It is a method by which an object can inherit the properties and
          methods of another object. Traditionally, in order to get and set the
          [[Prototype]] of an object, we use Object.getPrototypeOf and
          Object.setPrototypeOf. Nowadays, in modern language, it is being set
          using __proto__.

          What is a unit test? Why should write unit tests?
        </h1>
        <p>
          Unit tests are typically automated tests written and run by software
          developers to ensure that a section of an application (known as the
          "unit") meets its design and behaves as intended. In procedural
          programming, a unit could be an entire module, but it is more commonly
          an individual function or procedure.Modern versions of unit testing
          can be found in frameworks like JUnit, or testing tools like
          TestComplete. Look a little further and you will find SUnit, the
          mother of all unit testing frameworks created by Kent Beck, and a
          reference in chapter 5 of The Art of Software Testing . Before that,
          it's mostly a mystery. I asked Jerry Weinberg about his experiences
          with unit testing -- "We did unit testing in 1956. As far as I knew,
          it was always done, as long as there were computers".
